## ❌ **What DOESN'T Work on Gumroad**

### **PWAs Are Rare/Unsuccessful:**
- ❌ No PWAs in featured products
- ❌ No PWAs in trending software
- ❌ Users expect "real" downloadable software
- ❌ PWAs feel "less valuable" than native apps

### **Why PWAs Fail on Gumroad:**
1. **Perception**: "Why pay for a website?"
2. **Installation**: Confusing for non-technical users
3. **Value**: Harder to justify price vs. web tools
4. **Competition**: Free web alternatives exist

## 🎯 **Recommended Strategy for Price Monitor**

### **Option A: Electron Desktop App** (Highest Success Probability)
```javascript
// Package as native-feeling desktop app
const { app, BrowserWindow, Notification } = require('electron')

// Benefits:
✅ Looks/feels like native app
✅ Easy Gumroad packaging (.dmg, .exe)
✅ Higher perceived value ($25-50 range)
✅ Offline functionality
✅ System tray integration
```

**Gumroad Package:**
- `PriceMonitor-macOS.dmg` (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- `PriceMonitor-Windows.exe` 
- `PriceMonitor-Linux.AppImage`

### **Option B: License Key + Web App** (Good Alternative)
```python
# Hosted web app with license validation
class PriceMonitorPro:
    def validate_license(self, key):
        # Check against Gumroad purchase
        return key in valid_licenses
```

**Gumroad Package:**
- License key delivery
- Setup instructions
- Premium features unlocked

### **Option C: Python Executable Bundle** (Simplest)
